# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project Case Study
## 🚲 Cyclistic Case Study Project

Welcome to my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project!  
In this case study, I take on the role of a **junior data analyst** at **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.

This project follows the full data analysis process — **Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act** — to generate actionable insights aimed at converting **casual riders into annual members**.

---

## 🧩 Project Objective

Cyclistic’s director of marketing wants to increase the number of **annual memberships**, which are significantly more profitable than casual single-ride or day-pass users.

**Business Task**:  
> Identify how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently, and recommend strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

## 🔍 Tools Used

- **R (via RStudio)** – Data wrangling, transformation, and descriptive analysis  
- **Tableau** – Visualization of insights and usage trends

Data includes:
- Trip duration
