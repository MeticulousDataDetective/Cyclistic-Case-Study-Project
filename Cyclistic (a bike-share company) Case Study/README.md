This folder contains my work for a case study — the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification program — focused on a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic.

Two PDF files are present; one contains a report featuring the deliverables required for completing the case study, while the other features each of the data visualizations I made in Tableau Public.

The file "Analysis_of_Bike_Ride_Data.R" contains the R source code that I used to analyze and manipulate Cyclistic bike ride data in order to find patterns, develop insights, and make discoveries.

The file "avg_ride_length.csv" is a summary file that I exported using the R code in "Analysis_of_Bike_Ride_Data.R". This summary file contains the data from which I created visualizations in Tableau Public.

There is also a folder containing PNG image files for each of the Tableau data visualizations.
