This folder contains the original Cyclistic bike ride data, exactly as it was before I performed any cleaning, manipulation, or analysis. The data consists of two datasets: one covering Cyclistic bike rides from 2019 and the other from 2020. Each dataset is stored in a separate CSV file.

A spreadsheet (.xlsx) file containing the 2019 bike ride data is included. The 2020 spreadsheet file is not included here because it exceeds the upload size limit. Instead, you can access it via this Google Sheets link: [Raw Cyclistic 2020 Bike Rides Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tNWSRGY2uIJcPPewVc8ajJ38BTb9yotjtmUeaVaWc8s/edit?usp=sharing)
