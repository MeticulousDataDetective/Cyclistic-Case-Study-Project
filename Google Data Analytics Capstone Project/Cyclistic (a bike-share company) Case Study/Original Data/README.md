This folder contains the original Cyclistic bike ride data before I performed any 
cleaning, manipulations, or analyses on it. Two data sets were used in this case study; one data set contains data on Cyclistic 2019 bike rides, while the other contains data on the Cyclistic 2020 bike rides. Each data set is stored in a CSV file. 

There is also a spreadsheet file containing the 2019 bike ride data but not the spreadsheet file containing the 2020 bike ride data because it is too large to be uploaded here; instead, here is the link to the spreadsheet file in Google Sheets:
