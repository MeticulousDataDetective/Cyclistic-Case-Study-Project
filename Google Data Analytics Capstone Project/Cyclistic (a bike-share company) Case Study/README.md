This folder contains the work I completed for the case study regarding a fictional bike-share company called Cyclistic. 

Two PDF files are present; one contains a report featuring the deliverables required for completing the case study, while the other features each of the data visualizations I made in Tableau Public.

The file "Analysis_of_Bike_Ride_Data.R" contains the R source code that I used to perform analysis and manipulation of Cyclistic bike ride data in order to develop insights and make discoveries.

The file "avg_ride_length.csv" is summary file that I exported using the R code in "Analysis_of_Bike_Ride_Data.R". This summary file contains the data that I used in the creation of data visualizations in Tableau Public.

There is also a folder here containing image files for each of the data visualizations mentioned in the preceeding sentence.
